### **Result**

Thus the voltage shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency |f1 = 30Hz|f1' = 40Hz|
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency |f2 = 100KHz|f2' = 1MHz|
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 70KHz\) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 0.99MHz\) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 20.40\) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 19.71\) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point |Go = 20  |Go' = 18  |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the voltage-shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
