### **Result**

Thus the current shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency |f1 = 30Hz|f1' = 300Hz|
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency |f2 = 300KHz|f2' = 300KHz|
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 270KHz\) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 299.7KHz\) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 20.51\) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 20\) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point |Go = 19  |Go' = 17 |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
